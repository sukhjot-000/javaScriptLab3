const output = document.querySelector('#output');

/* STEP 1: Instead of a constructor function, let's try a JavaScript class called 'Coffee' */

// create constructor with keyword

// add a serveIt method

// Generate an IMG of the coffee ordered

// Set the src path for the IMG element

// Determine caffeine status of the coffee

// Set the size of the cup SVG image based on this.size

// Size the IMG in terms of its height based on above number from the switch

// Generate a description of the coffee and put it into the 
//IMG title attribute

// Insert the new IMG element into the paragraph

// Output all object member values

/* STEP 2: Instatiate a coffee based on the 
above constructor function */

/* STEP 3: Add a method to the Coffee class called serveIt() */

/* STEP 4: Call up the serveIt() method */

/* STEP 5: Define a subclass of the Coffee class */

/* STEP 6: Create a new instance of the Latte object */

/* STEP 7: Call up the latteDesc() method for the above created Latte instance */

/* STEP 8: Create yet another instance of Latte using the console, 
and try the latteDesc() method from the subclass, as well as the serveIt() method 
from the parent class */

/* Class Exercise: Using the coffee.html file, create a new constructor for a different type of coffee (like an Americano, Espresso or ???). 
Based on this new coffee on the Coffee object. 
Use the steps we followed to create Latte as your guide.*/
